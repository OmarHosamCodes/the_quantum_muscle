# Workout Screen Integration with Real Data

## Summary of Changes

The workout screen (`app/workout/[id].tsx`) has been successfully updated to use real data from Supabase instead of mock data.

## New Files Created

### 1. `src/lib/workoutService.ts`
A comprehensive service for managing workout operations:

- **`getWorkoutDetails(workoutId)`**: Fetches workout with exercises and sets from database
- **`updateSetCompletion(exerciseId, setNumber, data)`**: Updates or creates exercise set records
- **`completeWorkout(workoutId, userId)`**: Marks workout as completed
- **`getWorkoutProgress(workoutId)`**: Calculates completion percentage
- **`getUserWorkouts(userId)`**: Gets all workouts for a user
- **`createWorkout(workoutData)`**: Creates new workout

### 2. `src/hooks/useWorkout.ts`
A custom React hook for easier workout state management:

- Combines workout data fetching, set updates, and completion logic
- Handles loading states and error handling
- Provides clean API for components

## Key Features Implemented

### Real Database Integration
- Fetches workout data from `workouts` table
- Retrieves exercises from `exercises` table
- Manages exercise sets via `exercise_sets` table
- Handles missing data gracefully with sensible defaults

### Dynamic Set Management
- Creates set records when user inputs data
- Updates existing set records
- Tracks completion status based on reps > 0
- Supports both weighted and bodyweight exercises

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time calculation of completed vs total sets
- Visual progress bar updates as sets are completed
- Percentage-based progress indication

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for database operations
- Graceful fallbacks when data is missing
- User-friendly error alerts

## Database Schema Requirements

The implementation works with these existing tables:

```sql
-- Workouts table
workouts (
  id: string (primary key)
  name: string
  creator_id: string
  image_url: string (optional)
  created_at: timestamp
)

-- Exercises table  
exercises (
  id: string (primary key)
  name: string
  target_muscle: string
  workout_id: string (foreign key)
  content_type: enum ('image', 'video', 'text')
  content_url: string (optional)
  created_at: timestamp
)

-- Exercise sets table
exercise_sets (
  id: number (primary key)
  exercise_id: string (foreign key)
  set_index: number (0-based)
  reps: number
  weight_kg: number
)
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Using the hook in a component
const { workout, updateSet, completeWorkout, isLoading } = useWorkout(workoutId);

// Update a set
updateSet({
  exerciseId: "exercise-123",
  setNumber: 1,
  data: { reps: 10, weight_kg: 60, completed: true }
});

// Complete workout
completeWorkout({ userId: "user-123" });
```

## Benefits Over Mock Data

1. **Real-time persistence**: Set data is saved to database immediately
2. **Multi-device sync**: Progress syncs across user devices
3. **Data integrity**: Proper relationships between workouts, exercises, and sets
4. **Scalability**: Supports unlimited workouts and exercises
5. **Analytics potential**: Real data enables workout analytics and progress tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Add workout session tracking table for completion history
- Implement rest timer between sets
- Add exercise video/image display
- Create workout templates and sharing
- Add performance analytics and progress charts
- Implement offline support with sync when connection restored

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Ensure you have workouts in your database with associated exercises
2. Navigate to `/workout/[id]` with a valid workout ID
3. Try updating set reps and weights
4. Check that progress bar updates in real-time
5. Complete the workout and verify the success message

The screen will now fetch real data from your Supabase database and persist all user interactions.
