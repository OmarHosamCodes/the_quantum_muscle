## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Operations
```typescript
// Add exercise to workout
const exercise = await workoutService.addExerciseToWorkout({
  name: "Bench Press",
  target_muscle: "Chest",
  workout_id: "workout-123",
  content_url: "https://example.com/demo"
});

// Remove exercise (cascades to delete all sets)
await workoutService.removeExerciseFromWorkout(exerciseId);
```

### Navigation Flow
```
Workout Screen ‚Üí [Add Exercise Button] ‚Üí Create Exercise Screen ‚Üí [Submit] ‚Üí Back to Workout
```

### State Management
- Uses React Query for caching and synchronization
- Automatic invalidation when exercises are modified
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Create Exercise Screen
- **Muscle Group Grid**: 8 predefined muscle groups (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Core, Glutes, Cardio)
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected muscle groups highlighted with primary color
- **Pro Tips Section**: Helpful guidance for users
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches app's design system

### Workout Screen Enhancements
- **Add Exercise Card**: Visually distinct with icon and description
- **Exercise Actions**: Delete button with proper confirmation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## üì± User Experience

### Adding an Exercise
1. User taps "Add Exercise" button in workout screen
2. Navigates to create exercise screen with workout ID
3. Fills in exercise name and selects muscle group
4. Optionally adds reference content URL
5. Submits form and returns to workout with new exercise

### Deleting an Exercise
1. User taps delete (trash) icon on exercise card
2. Confirmation dialog appears with exercise name
3. User confirms deletion
4. Exercise and all associated sets are removed
5. Workout screen updates automatically

## üîí Data Integrity

### Cascade Deletion
- When an exercise is deleted, all associated `exercise_sets` are automatically removed
- Prevents orphaned data in the database
- Maintains referential integrity

### Validation
- Exercise name is required
- Muscle group must be selected
- URL validation for content links
- Duplicate name prevention could be added

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Queries**: Only fetches necessary data
- **Query Caching**: React Query handles caching automatically
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with loading states
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Targeted invalidation of specific queries

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Exercise Templates**: Pre-built exercise library
2. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Change exercise order
3. **Exercise Duplication**: Copy exercises between workouts
4. **Exercise Categories**: Filter by muscle group
5. **Exercise History**: Track previous performances
6. **Video Integration**: Embedded exercise demonstrations
7. **Equipment Tags**: Filter by available equipment

### Performance Improvements
1. **Image Optimization**: Compress and cache exercise images
2. **Offline Support**: Cache exercises for offline access
3. **Batch Operations**: Bulk add/remove exercises
4. **Search Functionality**: Find exercises quickly

## üìã Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Add exercise with all fields filled
- [ ] Add exercise with minimum required fields
- [ ] Test muscle group selection (both buttons and custom input)
- [ ] Verify navigation flow works correctly
- [ ] Test exercise deletion with confirmation
- [ ] Verify real-time updates after add/delete
- [ ] Test error handling (network issues, validation)
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Very long exercise names
- [ ] Special characters in exercise names
- [ ] Invalid URLs in content field
- [ ] Network disconnection during submission
- [ ] Rapid add/delete operations
